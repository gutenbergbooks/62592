<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">H</span>OW BEST to make small plumbing repairs is a problem that
comes to most householders, as it is sometimes difficult to secure
the services of a plumber. In such situations a little knowledge on
the part of the householder often saves much delay, trouble, and
expense. Where local or State plumbing regulations are in force, and
extensive repairs or alterations are contemplated, the householder
should make sure that the work is duly authorized and is done by
a properly qualified plumber.</p>

<p>Few persons realize the potential danger lurking in leaky waste
pipes, drains, and sewers, or in piping between systems, whereby
sewage or an impure water supply may even in the slightest degree
gain access to a potable water supply.</p>

<p>In making repairs it is often necessary to tighten or to loosen a
screw or nut, and the householder is sometimes uncertain in which
direction it should be turned. To screw or tighten an ordinary
right-hand screw, nut, or bolt, first think of the head of the part to
be turned as being the face of a clock and the screw driver or wrench
as being the shaft which turns the clock hands, and then rotate the
tool from left to right, in the same direction that the clock hands
move. Conversely, to unscrew or loosen, rotate the tool from right
to left, in the direction opposite to clockwise. Small brass screws and
stems are easily twisted off and rendered useless, especially if a large
tool is used to turn them. Undue strain should be avoided, as it
may result in the part or parts being broken at an unfortunate
time.</p>



<h2><a id="FAUCETS"></a>FAUCETS</h2>


<h3>SEAT WASHERS</h3>

<p>Badly worn washers make faucets noisy, hard to operate, and
wasteful of water. Moderate force on the handle of a faucet in good
repair should stop all flow and drip. <a href="#fig_1">Figure 1</a> shows an ordinary
half-inch <b>T</b>-handle compression faucet which closes against the pressure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
of the water. To replace the seat washer, shut off the water to
the faucet. Unscrew the cap nut with a monkey wrench. (Placing
cloth or thick paper between the jaws of the wrench saves marring
the cap nut.) Take hold of the faucet handle and unscrew the
stem from the body of the faucet. With
a screw driver remove the washer screw
at the bottom of the stem. This screw is
often hard to start. Applying one or two
drops of kerosene and lightly tapping the
head of the screw may help to loosen it
in the stem. Use strong, even force on
the screw driver, the blade of which
should have a good square edge to fit the
slot. The head of the screw often splits
before the shank of the screw turns in the
stem, because it is already corroded and
weakened. If it splits, deepen the slot in
the head with a hacksaw, cutting a little
into the shank of the screw. No harm
is done if the saw cuts slightly into the
stem of the faucet. The washer screw may
now be turned with a small screw driver. Replace the old washer
with a new one, replace the washer screw, screw the stem into the
faucet, and screw down the cap nut. Rubber and fiber composition
washers for hot- or cold-water faucets cost 10 to 15 cents a dozen.
A "floating" washer, costing 15 cents, is
very serviceable. A few washers of the
needed sizes should be kept in the home.
If none are at hand, a temporary washer
may be cut from a piece of leather, rubber,
or sheet packing. Leather is preferable on
cold-water faucets and rubber on hot-water
faucets.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_2">Figure 2</a> shows an ordinary <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>-inch,
4-ball-handle compression faucet for a
washstand. To replace the seat washer,
shut off the water to the faucet and open
the faucet one or two turns of the handle.
With a monkey wrench on the hexagonal
part of the stuffing box unscrew the stuffing
box from the body of the faucet. Lift
out the stem, replace the old washer with
a new one, as previously described, and
screw the stuffing box into the body.</p>

<p>A worn washer with constant leakage
over the seat of a compression faucet,
together with grit lodging there, often causes the seat to become
cut, nicked, and grooved. The trouble occurs more often in hot-water
than in cold-water faucets. Such seats can easily be reground
or squared with a simple seat dressing tool, two types of which are
shown in <a href="#fig_3">figure 3</a>, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. A seat dresser with four cutters for
different-sized faucets costs about $2, and its use saves buying new
faucets. To dress the seat of a faucet, unscrew the stem from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
body to the faucet, as above described. Screw the adjustable, threaded
cone of the tool (see <a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>, <i>A</i>) down into the body of the faucet, as
shown in <a href="#fig_3">figure 3</a>, <i>C</i>, thus centering it over the seat. With the hand,
as shown in <a href="#fig_3">figure 3</a>, <i>D</i>, gently rotate the wheel handle at the top of
the tool several times, and the cutter on the bottom of the stem squares
the seat. Turn the faucet bottom side up and shake out the cuttings.
Reassemble the faucet and turn on the water to wash out any
remaining cuttings.</p>

</div>

<p>Seat washers are subject to damage from metal filings left in newly
installed water pipes. A good plumber, before screwing up a piece
of pipe, always stands the pipe on end and raps it with a hammer
to clear the bore.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_4">Figure 4</a>, <i>A</i>, shows an ordinary half-inch lever-handle Fuller faucet
which closes with the pressure. As shown in <a href="#fig_4">figure 4</a>, <i>B</i>, the bottom
of the spindle is eccentric, so that slight turning of the handle
moves the rubber ball to and from the beveled seat. To replace the
ball shut off the water to the faucet. Unscrew the body from the
tailpiece with the hands or with a monkey wrench on the hexagonal
part of the body of the faucet. It may be necessary to apply a
wrench to the hexagonal nut on the tailpiece and press the wrench
downward to prevent unscrewing the tailpiece. Unscrew the stem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
nut, which holds the brass cap and rubber ball on the stem. Put on
a new ball and replace cap and nut. Red rubber balls are considered
to be better than black balls for hot-water faucets. Avoid
using too large a ball, as swelling of the rubber may hinder the
flow. Screw the faucet into the tailpiece. Just before the joint
closes or "makes up", wrap a little string packing or candle wicking
around the thread on the faucet to make the joint water-tight.</p>

<h3>TOP WASHERS AND PACKINGS</h3>

<p>A top washer or packing; snugly fitting the stem is necessary to
prevent leakage upward through the cap nut when a faucet is
opened. If the space is too tightly packed, the stem binds, nudging
it hard to operate the faucet; if too loosely packed, water spurts
from the top of the cap nut. <a href="#fig_5">Figure 5</a>, <i>A</i>, shows a soft rubber-and-fabric
top washer suitable for the compression faucet shown in
<a href="#fig_1">figure 1</a>. This washer is one-eighth of an inch thick and rests on the
top of the body of the faucet, making a water-tight joint when the
cap nut is screwed down. Just below the soft washer and inside
the top of the body a thin brass washer is placed to take the wear
when the faucet is fully opened. These washers are separated in the
illustration but are together when placed in a faucet.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 499px;">
<a id="fig_5"></a><img src="images/fig5.png" width="499" height="143" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Figure 5.&mdash;Top washers and packings: <i>A</i>, top washers commonly used in ordinary compression
faucets (<a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>); <i>B</i>, top washers which fill the space beneath the cap nut (fig.
1) <i>C</i>, candle wick packing and brass washer for washstand faucet (<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a>); <i>D</i>, spindle
packing for Fuller faucet (<a href="#fig_4">fig. 4</a>).</div>
</div>

<p>New faucets of the kind shown in <a href="#fig_1">figure 1</a> usually have the top
washers shown in <a href="#fig_5">figure 5</a>, <i>B</i>. The rubber washer fills the space
beneath the cap nut, and the thin fiber and brass washers are for the
purposes described above. If no top washer is available, the space
may be packed with candle wicking or soft twine, to which a little
mutton or beef tallow should be applied to lubricate the stem, to
preserve the packing, and to make it more impervious to water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span></p>

<p>When placing the top washer or washers on a compression faucet
of the kind shown in <a href="#fig_1">figure 1</a>, it is unnecessary to shut off the
water provided the faucet is closed. With the right hand keep the
faucet closed and with a monkey wrench in the left hand unscrew
the cap nut. Unscrew the handle screw and remove handle and cap
nut. Put on new washers as shown in <a href="#fig_5">figure 5</a>, <i>A</i>, or <a href="#fig_5">5</a>, <i>B</i>, and reassemble
the parts.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_5">Figure 5</a>, <i>C</i>, shows the stem packing for the washstand faucet
shown in <a href="#fig_2">figure 2</a>. The packing space is very small and is filled
with candle wicking lubricated with tallow. There is a thin brass
friction washer in the bottom of the stuffing box, and a hexagonal
packing nut screws into the top of the box. To renew the candle
wicking, keep the faucet closed. Unscrew the packing nut with a
monkey wrench, wrap a little wicking around the stem, and screw
the packing nut down against the wicking and into the stuffing box.</p>

<p>Spindle packing for a Fuller faucet (see <a href="#fig_4">fig. 4</a>) is shown in <a href="#fig_5">figure 5</a>,
<i>D</i>, and consists of three collars or rings obtainable from plumbing
dealers for a few cents. A lead ring or packing about one-eighth
of an inch long goes first (lowest) on the spindle; then a rubber-and-fabric
composition packing about one-fourth of an inch long; then a
brass packing about one-fourth of an inch long. Screwing down the
cap nut compresses the composition packing, and the metal packings
take up friction and wear. To put in new packings, shut off the
water from the faucet and remove the handle and cap nut, as described
in connection with compression faucets.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_6">Figure 6</a>, <i>A</i>, shows an adjustable socket-lever handle, ground key,
flat way, stop and waste cock to shut off water to part or all of a
piping system and to drain the
higher situated pipes from which
the flow is cut off. A stop and
waste should always be placed on
the house supply pipe just inside
the house or the cellar wall. They
are very useful on branch pipes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
from a cellar or kitchen to upstairs or back rooms subject to freezing
temperatures or other temporary discontinuance of the supply. <a href="#fig_6">Figure 6</a>,
<i>B</i>, shows the disassembled parts, all of which except the handle
are brass. The key or plug is ground to a water-tight fit in the body
of the cock, and water is turned on or off by giving the handle a
quarter turn. Turning the handle crosswise of the pipe shuts off the
supply, and the dead water drains back through the small round hole
in the side of the plug and out the waste tube.</p>

<p>Many stop and waste cocks have broken or bent handles or are
otherwise rendered useless, because people do not understand them.
As received from dealers, the nut on the bottom of the plug is generally
screwed up tight, making it difficult or impossible to turn the
handle and plug. Long periods of disuse frequently cause the plug
to stick fast in the body. The plug is easily loosened by slightly
unscrewing the bottom nut and striking the lower end of the plug a
few light blows with a hammer. Slight leakage caused by wear of
the plug or dirt around it may be prevented by cleaning the plug
and tightening the bottom nut. A plug badly worn from long or
continual use can be reground, but it is usually better and cheaper
to get a new plug or a complete new cock.</p>

<h2><a name="BALL_COCKS" id="BALL_COCKS">BALL COCKS</a></h2>


<p><a href="#fig_7">Figure 7</a>, <i>A</i>, shows an ordinary compound-lever ball cock to control
the water supply in a flush tank. The float ball and the seat
washer on the bottom of the plunger are the only parts likely to
need repairs. The
buoyancy of the float
is the force which
lowers the plunger, shutting off the water as the tank fills. A leaky,
water-logged float holds the plunger up, permitting constant flow and
waste of water. A small leak in a copper float can be soldered; but
if in bad condition, the float should be replaced by a new one. A
good copper, bakelite, or hard-rubber float 4 by 5 inches costs 25 to
50 cents.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 488px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Figure 7.&mdash;Ball cock; <i>A</i>, parts assembled; <i>B</i>, plunger, washer, and cap.</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#fig_7">Figure 7</a>, <i>B</i>, shows the plunger and washer-holder cap which screws
on the bottom of the plunger. The washer should be of soft rubber
or leather, because the force which holds it to its seat is not heavy.
The cap is thin brass. To replace the washer, shut off the water and
drain the tank. Unscrew the two thumbscrews which pivot the float-rod
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
lever and plunger lever. Push the two levers to the left, drawing
the plunger lever through the head of the plunger. Lift out the
plunger, unscrew the cap on the bottom of the plunger, insert a soft,
new washer, and reassemble the parts. The cap may be so corroded
and weakened that it breaks during removal from the plunger. A
new cap is then necessary, and it is well to have one or two on hand.
When putting a washer on a ball cock, examine the seat to see that
it is free of nicks and grit. The seat may need regrinding, as
explained under compression faucets.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Figure 8.&mdash;Flush valve for low tank.</div>
</div>


<p><a href="#fig_8">Figure 8</a> shows a common type of flush valve for a low tank.
Probably no other plumbing in the home needs attention so often.
It is under water and subject to fouling and neglect. The hollow
rubber ball gets out of shape and fails to drop squarely into the
hollowed seat. The handle and lever
fail to work smoothly or the lift
wires get out of plumb, causing the
ball to remain up when it should
drop to its seat. To remove these
difficulties, stop inflow to the tank
by holding up the float of the ball
cock or supporting it with a stick.
Drain the tank by raising the rubber
ball. If the ball is worn, out of
shape, or has lost its elasticity, unscrew the lower lift wire from the
ball and replace it with a new one.
A 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch rubber ball costs about
25 cents, and a new one should always
be kept in the house. The lift wires
should be straight and plumb. The
lower lift wire is readily centered
over the center of the valve by
means of the adjustable guide holder. By loosening the thumbscrew,
the holder is raised, lowered, or rotated about the overflow tube!
By loosening the lock nut and turning the guide screw, the horizontal
position of the guide is fixed exactly over the center of the valve,
these adjustments are very important. The upper lift wire should
loop into the lever armhole nearest to a vertical from the center of
the valve. A tank should empty within 10 seconds. Owing to
lengthening of the rubber ball and insufficient rise from its seat, the
time may be longer than 10 seconds and the flush correspondingly
weak. This trouble may be overcome by shortening the loop in the
upper lift wire. A drop or two of lubricating oil on the lever
mechanism makes it work more smoothly.</p>

<p>Rust and dirt in water pipes are more or less successfully removed
as follows: Tie a piece of small, stout cord to each end of a 2-foot
length of small chain. Each piece of cord should be a little longer

than the length of pipe to be cleaned. Attach the free end of one
of the cords to a stiff steel wire and push the wire and cord through
the pipe. By means of the cords pull the chain back and forth
through the pipe, and then thoroughly flush the pipe with clean
water under strong pressure. Long lines may be opened at intervals
and cleaned section by section.</p>

<p>Other methods are: Using a swab or wire brush attached to a
small steel or brass rod; flushing with a powerful hand pump; or
filling the pipe with diluted muriatic acid and allowing it to stand in
the pipe long enough for the acid to act. If the treatment is unsuccessful
it should be repeated. A mixture of 1 part of acid and 7 parts of
water allowed to stand overnight in 1,000 feet of badly rusted 1-inch
pipe has given good results. After the acid treatment the pipe
should be flushed long and thoroughly with clean water to remove
as fully as possible all dirt, rust, and traces of acid.</p>

<p>When new piping is put in, abrupt turns are sometimes made with
<b>T</b> branches instead of elbows. The unused leg of the branch can be
closed with a screw plug, thus permitting easy access to the interior
of the pipe.</p>

<p><b>Caution:</b> When a stop and waste (or valve) on a water service is
closed to permit cleaning or repairs, care should be taken to prevent
the formation of a vacuum in the high parts of the water piping and
the connections to plumbing fixtures; otherwise siphon action may draw pollution
from water closets having water-controlled
or seat-operated flush valves and from
bathtubs, washbasins, laundry tubs, or other
fixtures in which the spout (discharge end
of the water line) is lower than the fixture
rim, or worse, below the fixture overflow.
Vacuum and siphon action may be destroyed by opening the highest connected
faucet or an air cock in the top of the water
line or by equipping the system with suitable automatic vacuum breakers.</p>

</div>

<p>All waste pipes and traps are subject to
fouling. Dirt collects in the bottom and
grease adheres to the sides. The usual way
of clearing ordinary fixtures traps is to unscrew the clean-out ping, as
shown in <a href="#fig_9">figure 9</a>, and wash out the obstructing matter or pull it out
with a wire bent to form a hook. Small obstructions are often forced
down or drawn up by the use of a simple rubber force cup (sometimes
called "the plumber's friend") costing 30 to 60 cents. This
device is shown in <a href="#fig_10">figure 10</a>. The cup is placed over the fixture outlet
and the fixture is partially filled with water. The wood handle of the
cup is then worked rapidly down and up, causing alternate expulsion
of the water from beneath the cup and suction upward through the
waste pipe and trap. If a trap and the waste pipe from it are clogged
with grease, hair, or lint, it is best to open or disconnect the trap and
dig out the greasy matter with a stick. The use of chemical solvents
in waste pipes is explained in Farmers' Bulletin 1426, "Farm
Plumbing."</p>

<p>A variety of inexpensive flexible coil wire augers and sewer rods
are available for removing obstructions&mdash;mainly newspapers, rags,
toilet articles, grease, garbage, or other solids&mdash;from traps, waste
pipes, sewers, and drains. The growth of roots in sewers and drains
causes much trouble which better workmanship in making the joints
would have avoided. Augers and rods come
in various sizes and lengths. Stock lengths for
clean-out augers for closet bowls are 3, 6, and
9 feet and cost from $1 upward. <a href="#fig_11">Figure 11</a>
shows two kinds of flexible augers for general
purposes. The upper is 4 feet long and has a
small steel cable from the handle to the wire
hooks. The hooks can be drawn into the coil,
thus facilitating entry into a trap. The lower
auger is 8 feet long, has a crank handle and
corkscrew point generally preferred for closet-bowl work. Placing a few sheets of toilet
paper in the bowl and then flushing usually
indicates whether the obstruction has been dislodged.</p>

<h2><a name="THAWING_PIPES" id="THAWING_PIPES">THAWING PIPES</a></h2>


<p>The middle of a frozen pipe
should never be thawed first, because expansion of the water confined
by ice on both sides may burst
the pipe. When thawing a water pipe, work toward the supply,
opening a faucet to show when the flow starts. When thawing a
waste or sewer pipe, work upward from the lower end to permit the
water to drain away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span></p>

<p>Applying boiling water or hot cloths to a frozen pipe is simple and
effective. Where there is no danger of fire a torch or burning news-paper
run back and forth along the frozen pipe gives quick results.
Underground or otherwise inaccessible pipes may be thawed as
follows: Open the frozen water pipe on the house end. Insert one
end of a small pipe or tube. With the aid of a funnel at the other
end of the small pipe pour boiling water into it and push it forward
as the ice melts. A piece of rubber tubing may be used to connect
the funnel to the thaw pipe. Hold the funnel higher than the
frozen pipe, so that the hot water has head and forces the cooled
water back to the opening, where it may be caught in a pail. The
head may be increased and the funnel may be more conveniently used
if an elbow and a piece of vertical pipe are added to the outer end
of the thaw pipe, as shown in <a href="#fig_12">figure 12</a>. Add more thaw pipe at
the outer end until a passage is made through the ice. Withdraw
the thaw pipe quickly after the flow starts. Do not stop the flow
until the thaw pipe is fully removed and the frozen pipe is cleared
of ice. A small force pump is often used instead of a funnel and
is much to be preferred for opening a long piece of pipe. If available,
a jet of steam may be
used instead of hot water;
being hotter, it is more rapid.</p>

<p>Frozen traps and waste

<h2><a name="REMOVING_SCALE_FROM_WATER_BACKS_AND_COILS" id="REMOVING_SCALE_FROM_WATER_BACKS_AND_COILS">REMOVING SCALE FROM WATER BACKS AND COILS</a></h2>


<p>Hard water causes a limy deposit or scale on the inside of water
backs and heating coils. If allowed to accumulate the scale retards
the circulation and heating of the water and, by closure of the bore,
may prove dangerous. Moreover, continued neglect makes it increasingly
difficult to remove the scale.</p>

<p>The water back or coil should be removed from the fire box. At
the union or other joints nearest the fire box disconnect all pipes and
unscrew them from the water back. If there is a clamp which holds
the fire-brick lining against the oven, loosen it and remove side and
end linings. Lift out the water back and take it out on the ground.
Soft scale or sludge may be removed by pounding the water back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
with a mallet or hammer and then flushing with a strong jet of
water. A long gouge or chisel is used on those surfaces that can be
reached. Sometimes the water back is heated in a blacksmith's forge
and then pounded, but unless carefully done this treatment may
break it. Some householders keep a spare water back for use while
the other is being cleaned.</p>

<p>Waters of varying chemical composition cause scale differing in
composition and hardness. Ordinary limestone (calcium carbonate)
scale, if not of excessive thickness, may readily be removed with
muriatic acid. Gypsum (calcium sulphate) scale is hard and resistant
and with other constituents in their more compact forms is little
affected by muriatic acid. The water back should be laid on the
ground and filled with a strong solution of the acid in water. The
strength of the solution should vary with the amount of deposit,
the ordinary mixture being 1 part of acid and 5 to 7 parts of water.
If the deposit is very thick, the acid needs little dilution. Commercial
muriatic acid in bottles containing 6 pounds (about 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
quarts) costs 20 to 25 cents a pound. The bottle should be labeled
"Muriatic acid&mdash;poison"; and, like the chemicals previously mentioned,
it should be kept where children cannot get it. Heating the
water back hastens the action of the acid. At the end of an hour
or two, or sooner if the deposit is dissolved, pour the solution from
the water back and flush it thoroughly with hot water to remove the
acid. If all the deposit has not been removed, repeat the operation,
making sure that the acid is completely washed out before replacing
the water back. In replacing the water back it is important to have
it level, using a spirit level for this purpose.</p>

<p>Similar methods may be used with copper coils. Place the coil
(or heater) on two sticks over a large bowl. With the aid of a lead
funnel pour the acid solution down through the coil. Dip from the
bowl and continue to circulate the solution through the coil until
the deposit is dissolved. The coil should then be thoroughly washed
out with hot water.</p>

<p>The hot-water flow pipe close to a water back or coil frequently
becomes thickly covered with scale. If the pipe is brass, it may be
disconnected and treated with acid and then washed out with hot
water. If the pipe is galvanized iron and in bad condition, it will
probably be more satisfactory to replace it with new pipe.</p>

<h2><a name="LEAKS_IN_PIPES_AND_TANKS" id="LEAKS_IN_PIPES_AND_TANKS">LEAKS IN PIPES AND TANKS</a></h2>


<p>A small leak in a water pipe can be stopped in an emergency as
follows: Place a flat rubber or leather gasket over the leak and hammer
a piece of sheet metal to fit over the gasket; secure both to the
pipe with a clamp obtainable at hardware or 5-and-10-cent stores.
A small leak under low pressure is sometimes stopped by shutting off
the water and then embedding the pipe in richly mixed portland-cement
mortar or concrete. Broken sewer pipe can be repaired in
like manner, and a wrapping of wire netting embedded in the mortar
or concrete increases its strength. However, it is better to relay the
sewer and make all joints water-tight and root-proof as described
in Farmers Bulletin 1227, Sewage and Sewerage of Farm Homes.
A small hole in cast-iron pipe may be tapped for a screw plug.</p>

<p>Where a leaky screw joint cannot be tightened with a pipe wrench,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
the leak is sometimes stopped with a blunt, chisel or calking tool and
hammer. Sometimes a crack or hole is cleaned out and then plugged
and calked with lead, or a commercial iron cement mixed to the consistency
of stiff putty. Sometimes a pipe band, a clamp with two
bolts (similar to but stronger than the one shown in <a href="#fig_14">fig. 14</a>), or a
split sleeve is employed to hold a thin coating of iron cement or a
gasket over a leak. If the leak is at a screw joint, the band is usually
coated inside with one-eighth of an inch of iron cement and then
slipped over the pipe. Keeping the bolt farthest from the coupling
or fitting a little tighter than the other, both bolts, are tightened.
During the tightening, the band should be driven with a hammer
snugly against the coupling or fitting.</p>

<p>In addition to these methods and devices, there are several kinds
of good, inexpensive, ready-made pipe and joint repairers obtainable
of manufacturers and dealers.</p>

<p>A corroded and leaky spot in a steel tank or range boiler can be
closed with an inexpensive repair bolt or plug obtainable from dealers.
<a href="#fig_13">Figure 13</a> shows a home-made repairer consisting of a three-sixteenths
by 3-inch toggle bolt costing 10 cents and a flat rubber
gasket, brass washer, and nut. The link of the bolt, after being
passed through the hole, takes an upright position, and screwing up
the nut forces the gasket tightly against the outside of the boiler.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 499px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Figure 13.&mdash;Home-made repairer; <i>A</i>, passing the link of the toggle bolt through
the hole (enlarged) in the tank; <i>B</i>, side view of edge of tank with bolt, washers, and

</div>

<p>A small hole must be reamed or enlarged with a round file to a diameter
of about five-eighths inch. The metal beneath the gasket
should be firm and clean. A little candlewick packing may be
wrapped around the bolt to prevent leakage along the bolt. Sometimes
a hole is closed by driving in a tapered steel pin to turn the
metal inward, forming a surface which can be tapped for an ordinary
screw plug. A hole in the wall of a tank or pipe having considerable
thickness can be easily and quickly closed by screwing in
a tapered steel tap plug which cuts and threads its way through the
wall. These plugs in different sizes are obtainable of dealers and a
monkey wrench is the only tool required to insert them; it is unnecessary
to shut off or drain the water from the tank or pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span></p>

<p>A small leak at a seam or rivet can often be closed by merely rubbing
a cold chisel along the beveled edge of the joint. Do not attempt
to calk a seam unless the plates have considerable thickness
and the rivets are closely spaced and are close to the calking edge,
and then use extreme caution. Run a regular calking tool or blunt
chisel along the beveled edge, tapping the tool very lightly with a
light hammer to force the edge of the upper plate against and into
the lower plate.</p>

<p>Cracks in slate, soapstone, or cement laundry tubs are made water-tight
with a mixture of litharge and glycerin or a specially prepared
commercial cement. The litharge and glycerin are mixed and stirred
to form a smooth heavy paste free from lumps. The crack should be
cleaned out to remove all grease and dirt and the paste should be
worked into the crack with a case knife. A paste of portland cement
and water, or of the white of an egg and fresh lump lime, has been
used successfully for this purpose.</p>
